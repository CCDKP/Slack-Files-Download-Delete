# Slack-Files-Download-Delete
Based off the code by DrewRomanyk (https://github.com/DrewRomanyk)

This can list, download, and optionally delete all slack files associated with channels or usernames
that are greater than 30 days old and that have a download url with them.

In addition, this application saves three metadata files, which provide all the information about the files scanned,
including original uploader, time, comments, reactions, and title.

Files are saved with the following naming convention:
<Uploading Username>_<Timestamp>_<Unique file id>_<Sanitized filename>

# Setup
This requires a Slack Legacy Token (https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)
Unless the token is generated by an Admin account, you will only be able to delete files uploaded by the token owner.

There are a few options that can be configured at the top of the program
